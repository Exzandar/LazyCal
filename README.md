# LazyCal
This is LazyCal and it's a voice assistant helps me to do computations and it's based on google and wolframalpha APIs 
lazuCal can help you in computing beacuse it's a computational knowledge engine.
It's slow but it works well!
you can ask it about anything needs computations such as distance between Egypt and Japan, distance between Earth and Moon and you can ask it about dates, weather and formulas too.
to run it in your device you should install ["gtts", "speechrecognition", "playsound", "wolframalpha", "pyaudio"].
